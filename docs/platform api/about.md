# Platform API

This is the project handling our user data, as well any business logic surrounding the data, and exposes them using
rest apis.

The platform API is coded using Spring Boot. It's recommended to know a bit about Spring before looking too deep into
the platform api. There's a small introduction to spring [here](./spring.md).
